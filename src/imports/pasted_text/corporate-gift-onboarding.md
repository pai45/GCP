Create a high-fidelity interactive desktop web prototype for a self-serve Corporate Gift Card Onboarding journey for Pine Labs.

Product context:
This is a corporate gift card procurement portal where SMBs and enterprises can sign up, verify their company, complete compliance/KYC checks, and later configure portal users for gift card ordering. The flow should reduce drop-off by using autofill, progressive disclosure, fewer mandatory fields, and post-approval setup for non-compliance tasks.

Design style:
Use a clean, premium B2B SaaS style inspired by Pine Labs.
Use a white background, soft grey dividers, subtle green highlights, rounded cards, clean input fields, and clear step progress.
Primary brand color: deep Pine green #006B5E.
Secondary background: #F5FAF8.
Text color: #1D2939.
Muted text: #667085.
Success green: #12B76A.
Warning amber: #F79009.
Error red: #D92D20.
Use modern sans-serif typography.
Keep the interface minimal, spacious, and easy to scan.

Canvas:
Create a desktop prototype at 1440px width.
Use a persistent left sidebar for journey steps.
Use a top navigation bar with Pine Labs logo, page title “Corporate Gift Card Procurement”, and a “Save & exit” action.
Footer should include Terms of use, Privacy policy, and Support links.

Main goal:
Design an end-to-end onboarding journey with the following simplified flow:

1. Account owner
2. Company verification
3. Authorised signatory
4. Review & submit
5. Verification status
6. Post-approval portal setup

Important UX principle:
Do not show every field at once. Use progressive disclosure.
Ask only the minimum required information upfront.
Move operational setup like maker-checker, add users, and sales POC to post-approval setup.

UX writing style:
Clear, professional, reassuring, and minimal.
Avoid legal-heavy language unless necessary.
Use helper text to explain why information is being asked.
Replace “Upload Documents” with “Documents” because documents may not always be needed.
Avoid saying “10 of 10 fields pre-filled” if the user still has to complete fields.
Use copy like:
“8 details filled automatically. 2 need your review.”
“Only upload documents if verification needs them.”
“You can finish portal setup after business verification.”

Components to create:

- Sidebar stepper
- Header/top nav
- Form card
- Input fields
- Dropdowns
- Checkbox
- Radio/segmented controls
- Upload card
- Status banner
- Review summary card
- Confirmation modal
- Empty dashboard state
- User table
- Success state

Important simplification:
Do not include Pine Labs Sales POC in the main onboarding.
Do not force maker-checker setup during compliance onboarding.
Do not ask users to upload GST or CIN documents upfront if GSTIN/CIN verification succeeds.
Do not repeat contact details across multiple screens.
Do not ask for TAN unless needed later for tax/invoice setup.

Final prototype should feel like a smooth B2B onboarding flow that can be completed in under 5 minutes.
